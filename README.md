# Overview

This Movable Feast Machine demo is based on [a previous one](https://github.com/mngr777/UlamSimpleTrees).

Three programmable agents are used to build and maintain a 2-layer membrane.
The main idea is to move most of hardcoded behavior to program trees and universal "physical laws" (in this demo -- attraction/repulsion between atoms).
Hardcoded parts are building program trees (`TreeBuilder` element) and setting initial conditions for the demo.

# Setting initial conditions
